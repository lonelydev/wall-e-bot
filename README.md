# Wall-e-bot Listens to slack and adds messages to DynamoDb

This is an attempt at learning how to build a slack bot that listens to mentions on slack
and then adds part of the message to DynamoDb following 
[Anton Putra's tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUIptoPXu_8).

Unlike the earlier experiment I did on slack following the slack documentation, this one is more interactive.

The idea is to combine this with the other one and productionise the application and deploy it to the slack workspace.
